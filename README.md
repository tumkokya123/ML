# People Counting Using YOLOv5 + DeepSORT

This project detects and counts people passing through a frame in a video using:

- **YOLOv5** for object detection
- **DeepSORT** for multi-object tracking
- **OpenCV** for video processing and visualization

## 📽️ How it works

1. Input video is passed through YOLOv5 to detect people.
2. DeepSORT assigns unique IDs to track individuals across frames.
3. Final video displays bounding boxes, person IDs, and total people counted.

## 📁 Files

- `PeopleCount.ipynb`: Colab-ready notebook
- `5am.mp4`: Your input video (upload separately)
- `output.mp4`: Final annotated result (generated by the notebook)

## 🔧 Setup

Run the notebook in Google Colab — no local setup required.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add region-based counting
- Deploy to real-time camera feed
